# Machine-Learning

Welcome to my GitHub !

This repository has been created to store all the LABs I have made during Machine Learning lessons.

All the LABs I have made will be merged to this repository.
For each LAB, I will create a branch with the name of the LAB.
In each branch, you will find the Python file, a HTML file containing all the Python code (in case of combatibility problem with the Python file) and all other required files for the LAB.

Hope these works will meet your expectations.

Kind regards,
Gr√©goire ISSASSIS (254715)
